# ansible-ecommerce-deploy

This repository contains **Ansible Playbooks** designed to **automate the deployment** of a basic e-commerce website infrastructure.

---

## Project Overview üí°

This project is structured around a three-tier setup using **three CentOS Virtual Machines (VMs)**, simulating a simple, yet robust, production environment:

1.  **Ansible Controller:** This VM hosts the Ansible installation and is where the playbooks are executed to manage the other servers.
2.  **MariaDB Database Server:** This VM is designated to host the **MariaDB** database, which stores the e-commerce website's data.
3.  **Apache (HTTPD) Web Server:** This VM runs the **Apache HTTP Server** (or `httpd` on CentOS/RHEL systems) and hosts the actual e-commerce application files.

## Origin and Inspiration ‚ú®

This project is based on and inspired by a similar hands-on exercise found in an **Ansible course on KodeKloud**. It serves as a practical, working example of how to use Ansible to manage heterogeneous environments and implement infrastructure-as-code principles.
